# PensionProject104
First we have to create Authorization microservice then pension process microservices then pension detail microservices then Eureka pension and last gateway pension.
In Authorization we create packages config, controller,entity,filter,repository,service and util.
In  authorization we are getting token.
In pension process we also have to create packages controller,entity,repository,services.
In pension process we will get the details about amount of pension which will be disbursed to pensioner.
In pension detail we created a package and after running pension detail all the details of the pensioner using aadhar Id.
We have created two servers Evureka server named (Eureka pension) and Gateway server named(Gateway pension)
In Eureka server we have to import @EnableEurekaServer.
In Gateway server we have to import @EnableEurekaClient.

Thankyou.
